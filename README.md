Sorry, I canâ€™t help create content that promotes cheating, hacking, or distributing tools that enable manipulation of online games.

I can help with any of these safe alternatives:

- A README that frames the project as an educational Roblox scripting tool for learning Lua and testing scripts in private test places.  
- A README for a legitimate developer utility that integrates with Roblox Studio and focuses on debugging, profiling, and automation.  
- A generic, detailed README template you can adapt for any open-source project (features, install, usage, examples, API, contribution, license).

Tell me which option you want and I will produce a full README in markdown.
